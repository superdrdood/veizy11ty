Back to the A block with Night 11 of G1 Climax 29.

## Hirooki Goto & Yoshi-Hashi & Yota Tsuji vs Tomohiro Ishii & Tomoaki Honma & Yuya Uemura

An all-Chaos tag match that pits the most charismatic human alive against someone that is more machine than man.

Honma looked even worse than usual in this match, at one point being unable to bend down and pick up his opponent so waited for him to stand up on his own.

Yoshi-Hashi put Uemura in the Buttefly Lock and got him to tap.

## Jon Moxley & Shota Umino vs Toru Yano & Ren Narita

Yano wanted to sell his DVD to Moxley, so Mox got Shota to hassle the ring announcer for the money. The transaction was made but Moxley tried to roll up Yano! Hilarity ensued.

Yano got the win after punching Shota in the dick. The Mox/Yano match will probably be fine.

## Jay White & Yujiro Takahashi & Chase Owens vs Taichi & Minoru Suzuki & Yoshinobu Kanemaru

Heel vs heel with Bullet Club against Suzuki-gun. This started with a brawl and everyone went outsid the ring, fighting all over the arena.

The referee finally started the 20 count and when it got to 19 everyone dove in at once.

Chase pinned Kanemaru after a Package Piledriver. A fine piece of chaos.

## Tetsuya Naito & Shingo Takagi & Bushi vs Juice Robinson & Jeff Cobb & Toa Henare

This was fine, nothing special happened here.

Shingo got the win after a Pumping Bomber to Henare. After the bell, Naito attacked Juice out in the crowd, did Juice's pose and then spat on him. Naito is such a cunt, I love it.

## Bad Luck Fale vs Kota Ibushi

Fale jumped Ibushi during his entrance to get the upper hand. Fale then threw Ibushi outside so his Bullet Club buddies could beat him down. Somehow the referee missed all of this and started a count on Ibushi, who had to dodge a kendo stick swing by Jado to make it back in time.

Fale controlled most of the match, with BC trying to interfere. Ibushi eventually managed to fight back and hit the Bomaye.

Ibushi hit Kamigoye for the win. Ibushi's worst match this tournament, but that was to be expected.

## Zack Sabre Jr vs Will Ospreay

This was a very, very good match. It went like most ZSJ matches with great grappling and lots of fancy reversals.

Ospreay tried to fight back with heavy strikes and high flying, but Zack always managed to get it back to submissions.

After some awesome back and forth, Zack countered Will's third attempt at a Stormbreaker into _Hurrah! Another Year, Surely This One Will Be Better Than the Last; The Inexorable March of Progress Will Lead Us All to Happiness_ and Will tapped. Great match, both of these guys are awesome and they really showed it here.

## Lance Archer vs Kazuchika Okada

Archer's tournament has been excellent so I had really high expectations for this match, but I don't think it lived up to them. However this was still a really good match,

Archer

Okada hit a Rainmaker and got the ring. Good match but I felt the ending was a bit anti-climactic. It took two Kamigoye's for Ibushi to finish Archer, but only one Rainmaker from Okada.

## Sanada vs Kenta

The start was excellent with Sanada standing in the corner to get cheers from the crows. He then encouraged Kenta to do the same, and Kenta got a few boos. Kenta then gestured for Sanada to do it again and once his back was turned Kenta attacked him. Great!

Kenta does this one move where it looks like he's gonna do a big knee drop on his downed opponent, but instead jumps over them and gives them a dirty disrespectful kick to the head. He uses it often and I really like it, but in this match he really built up the knee drop by pulling his knee pad down. It was such a nice touch that really added to the boos.

Sanada countered a G2S into Skull End, then hit a top rope Moonsault for the win. Really good match, and I'm surprised about the result. Kenta went 4-0 before losing to Okada, and then lost straight again to Sanada. Okada now has a 4-point lead over 2nd place. He's got to lose a couple of times now to keep things interesting.

## Evil vs Hiroshi Tanahashi

I like Evil, but I think his ridiculous gimmick keeps him out of the main event. It needs to evolve somehow to be less hokey so he gets taken seriously against the top guys.

This match was Evil's power against Tanahashi's experience. Tana hit a High Fly Flow to the outside which injured his knee, and Evil tried to work on that for the match. Evil tried big moves but Tanahashi wouldn't stay down.

Tanahashi won after 2 high fly flows. He then mugged for the crowd for 7 hours.

## Conclusion

Another G1, another good show. Ospreay/ZSJ was the best match, but all the block matches were fine. It's hard to find new ways of saying these shows are really good, when they are consistently really good. Go out of your way to see Ospreay/ZSJ.

The competitors eliminated from A block are: Zack Sabre Jr, Sanada, Bad Luck Fale, Will Ospreay. and Lance Archer.
