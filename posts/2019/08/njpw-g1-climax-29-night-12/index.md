Back to B block action in yet another night of G1.

I was out for an evening, and then out for a day and have managed to fall 3 shows behind in the G1. My Sunday is going to be watching G1, which will be nice.

## Bad Luck Fale & Yujiro Takahashi & Chase Owens vs Kenta & Clark Connors & Karl Fredericks

Fale and Kenta on the next show doesn't interest me. Chase has a new haircut that commentary were insulting. I agree with their insults.

Chase pinned Connors after a Package Piledriver.

## Lance Archer & Yoshinobu Kanemaru vs Zack Sabre Jr & Minoru Suzuki

This is an all Suzuki-gun match and was pretty awesome. Zack and Suzuki did a sneak attack on Archer and Kanemaru during their entrance, and the match started with a big brawl on the outside.

Most of the match was a big brawl, clearly no faction niceties were being shown here.

Zack won with a fancy pin on Yoshinobu Kanemaru, ZSJ/Archer should be good!

There was a brilliant backstage promo from after this match that got posted after the show, where Zack says he's going to get crushed like a peanut, and Archer says he's going to eat Zack and shit him out in the middle of the ring. This is prime wrestling promo!

## Kota Ibushi & Tomoaki Honma & Toa Henare vs Hiroshi Tanahashi & Shota Umino & Ren Narita

Ibushi/Tanahashi was the final of last year's G1 and was possibly the best match of the entire tournament, and they're going a rematch on the next show. Tanahashi has slowed down a little since then, but I'm sure it will also be amazing.

Honma won with a Toa Bottom on Ren Narita. I can't wait for Ibushi/Tanahashi!

## Evil & Sanada & Bushi vs Kazuchika Okada & Will Ospreay & Yoshi-Hashi

Ospreay/Evil and Sanada/Okada are coming up, both of which sound great. However they were all overshadowed by the epitome of human charisma who was also in this match.

To prove he isn't just a pretty face, Yoshi-Hashi got the win by tapping out Bushi with the Butterfly Lock.

## Shingo Takagi vs Jeff Cobb

This was a big hoss fight, two large power guys smashing into each other, and better than I expected.

One cool spot had Cobb hitting Shingo with a T-bone Suplex, and then Shingo hitting his own. It was really cool.

Shingo hit a lot of big moves on the huge man Cobb, he got him up for lots of suplexes which was very impressive considering the size difference.

Cobb hit Tour of the Islands and got the win. Really nice match. These two have good chemistry.

## Jon Moxley vs Toru Yano

Yano sprayed water in Moxley's face before the bell, pissing off Moxley.

Yano then tried to give back he DVD he sold to Moxley the other night, along with a bunch of money. Moxley kicked it away spraying money everywhere.

The two had a sword fight using the turnbuckle pads, but that was over very quickly.

Yano did a double dick punch to Moxley and Shota, then taped their legs together. Moxley then got counted out! Upset shocker!

## Tetsuya Naito vs Juice Robinson

This match was really good and hard-hitting. I like Juice a lot, and I think he's stepped up his game considerably during this G1.

Naito's ear started bleeding during the match, not sure if he was close to ripping it off or something? It looked really gnarly.

Naito won after a second Destino. Nice match.

## Jay White vs Taichi

This ended up being much better than I thought it would be. Both of these guys use bullshit in their matches, and the double bullshit was great.

Jay won after a Blade Runner. Good match.

## Hirooki Goto vs Tomohiro Ishii

These two smashed into each other over and over and I loved every second of it.

There was a forearm exchange between the two that lasted forever, and it was amazing.

Goto won with a GTR. Great match.

## Conclusion

Really, really good show. All the block matches were great. One of the better shows of the tournament. And also my comments are shorter than usual because I have catching up to do!

Taichi and Shingo Takagi are both eliminated, but everyone else in B block is still alive. Let's see who goes next.
