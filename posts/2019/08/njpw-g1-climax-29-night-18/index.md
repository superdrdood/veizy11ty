The B block finals for G1 Climax 29! Yeah!

## Shota Umino & Ren Narita vs Yota Tsuji & Yuya Uemura

This was a good Young Lions match, and they all showed a lot of fire.

The finish had Narita putting Uemura in a Boston Crab, and Uemura refusing to tap. He was in the move for what felt like an age as Narita kept pulling him away from the ropes. It was very Bret/Austin from WrestleMania 13. Uemura did eventually tap after Narita sat down on it.

## Bad Luck Fale & Chase Owens & Yujiro Takahashi vs Evil & Sanada & Bushi

I didn't see this!

Yujiro pinned Bushi.

## Kenta & Clark Connors & Karl Fredericks vs Kota Ibushi & Tomoaki Honma & Toa Henare

This match was fine, there was one awesome spot with Ibushi and Kenta kicked the other in the face simultaneously, it looked awesome.

Toa pinned Fredericks after the Toa Bottom.

## Zack Sabre Jr & Lance Archer & Minoru Suzuki & Yoshinobu Kanemaru vs Kazuchika Okada & Hiroshi Tanahashi & Will Ospreay & Yoshi-Hashi

This match started as you'd expect with Suzuki-gun attaching everyone from behind and causing general chaos.

Tanahashi got the win, as he reversed an armbar Zack had on him into a pin. They have since set up a Tanahashi/ZSJ match for Royal Quest! I am going to Royal Quest, so that will be nice!

## Jeff Cobb vs Toru Yano

At the start of the match the ref checked Yano for any hidden weapons, and he found a few rolls of tape. Yano tried to apologise but then the ref found a whole bunch more tape done his arse. Hilarity!

This was then typical Yano nonsense, with taking down the turnbuckle pads and trying to fight on the outside.

Cobb pinned Yano after Tour of the Islands. This was fine.

## Taichi vs Tomohiro Ishii

This was much more of an Ishii match than a Taichi match, which meant it was really awesome.

Taichi won clean with Black Mephisto.

## Jon Moxley vs Juice Robinson

Shota came out with Moxley in a Deathriders jacket, which was cute

Moxley worked over Juice's injured knee throughout most of the match. He also kept trying to use weapons such as a chair and table, but Juice got his hands on them and hid them away.

Moxley thought he had won after putting Juice in an STF, as Juice was passed out. Moxley let go of the hold but the ref said Juice was still alive. So Moxley hit a couple of other big moves and then in his anger went out for more weapons.

This distraction caused Juice to gather himself and hit some stiff punches and the Pulp Friction for the win. I didn't like this finish because it made Moxley look like a bit of an idiot, if they wanted his anger to get the best of him I think it could have been done better. Good match aside from the last minute.

## Shingo Takagi vs Hirooki Goto

This was a great hard-hitting match between these two, which is just what you'd expect. I love this style and this match was a great example of it.

There was an absolutely killer Pumping Bomber that Goto ran straight into, it's one of the best clotheslines I've perhaps ever seen.

Shingo won with Last of the Dragon. Great match!

## Jay White vs Tetsuya Naito

The crowd booed the hell out of Jay White during his entrance, I love it! They were very much behind Naito.

This was fine, but a bit underwhelming. I've said in my reviews of other Naito matches that I think he's slowed down quite a lot during this tournament, I don't know if it because of an injury or just age or something. But Jay was moving much quicker than him and looked much, much better.

At one point Jay pulled the ref into him knocking Red Shoes down, then Gedo came in and tried to hit Naito with brass knuckles. Naito blocked it and instead kicked Gedo in the dick! Yeah!

My predictions were right, as Jay won after a very long finisher counter-battle and hit the Blade Runner. Jay White is the B block winner!

After the match he got a microphone and insulted Naito a little, then he asked Kota Ibushi to come out to the ring. Jay promised that the final match tomorrow would be 1-on-1 and he wouldn't have Gedo at ringside, but then he and Gedo attacked Ibushi and smashed his ankle repeatedly with a chair.

## Conclusion

Good show, but a slight letdown. Goto/Takagi was the best match of the night and I found the main event underwhelming. I really think something is wrong with Naito as he hasn't been on his game during this G1 at all. The finals tomorrow should be super hot, with Kota Ibushi against Jay White.
