Night 15 is A block matches, lovely.

## Taichi & Minoru Suzuki & Yoshinobu Kanemaru vs Toru Yano & Yuya Uemura & Yota Tsuji

Unsurprisingly Suzuki-gun attacked before the bell and made quick work of Yano and the Young Lions.

Taichi took Yano over to the commentators and jammed a microphone down his throat. All you could hear was loud, muffled choking and it was great. Taichi then used the cable for Kevin Kelly's headphones to strangle Yano, ripping the headphones off of Kevin's head. Taichi hugely inconveniencig the commentators is hilarious.

Kanemura got the win with a boston crab on Yuya. Suzuki chaired the hell out of Yota on his way out.

## Jon Moxley & Shota Umino vs Hirooki Goto & Yoshi-Hashi

Moxley and Goto started out, with lots of forearms. Eventually Shota got tagged in and then he got beat down.

Yoshi-Hashi locked Shota in the Butterfly Lock and tapped him out for the win. Moxley/Goto tomorrow will be nice.

## Jay White & Chase Owens & Yujiro Takahashi vs Juice Robinson & Tomoaki Honma & Toa Henare

Juice/Jay doesn't interest me too much.

Chase pinned Toa after a Package Piledriver. Fine. After the match Jay jumped Rocky Romero on commentary. The English commentators aren't having the best evening.

## Tetsuya Naito & Shingo Takagi & Bushi vs Tomohiro Ishii & Jeff Cobb & Ren Narita

Poor Rocky. Naito kicked him out of commentary and took his place during his entrance. Naito exchanged some Spanish with Kevin Kelly who didn't really know much. That was hilarious.

Cobb hit a double suplex on Naito and Bushi, it looked really cool. Ren Narita did a really cool roll thing trying to get a Texas Cloverleaf on Bushi, but Shingo kicked him in the face. It's like the Young Lion was shining but only for a second.

Bushi pinned Narita after an MX. Ishii/Shingo tomorrow will be awesome, I'm looking forward to it. Naito did a really dickish sneak attack on Cobb after the match.

## Lance Archer vs Sanada

Archer was in control for the vast majority of the match, keeping Sanada from getting much offence in.

Archer went for a top rope moonsault but Sanada moved out of the way. Sanada went for his own and Archer got his knees up. That was really nice.

Archer tried to hit the Blackout but Sanada reversed into Skull End. Archer reversed that into Blackout again, but Sanada wriggled out and won with a really fancy bridging pin. Nice match.

## Bad Luck Fale vs Hiroshi Tanahashi

This match went about as well as you'd expect.

Tanahashi hit a High Fly Flow to Fale's back, went up to hit another but Jado hit him with a kendo stick. Fale hit the grenade and went for the Bad Luck Fall but Tanahashi tried to counter into a backslide. Fale then countered that into a backslide of his own and got the win!

Fale won with a backslide! What?!?! Total shocker.

## Kenta vs Will Ospreay

Very good match between these two. This is somewhat of a dream match.

Kenta seemed a bit off, he messed up a spring board forearm, and also fell over when Ospreay tried to powerbomb him.

Ospreay won with a nasty Hidden Blade followed up with a Stormbreaker. Really good match and again shocked by the ending, Kenta started the G1 winning 4 in a row, and has now lost 4 in a row.

## Zack Sabre Jr vs Kota Ibushi

Zack did his usual submission nastiness, Ibushi has an injured ankle so there was an easy target.

There were some strikes between the two, but they usually devolved to Zack grabbing something and trying a submission. He tried some strikes of his own against Ibushi but all they did was get him angry.

Ibushi won with a Bomaye followed by Kamigoye. Really good match.

## Evil vs Kazuchika Okada

Really good match here. After Sanada beat Okada at the last A block show, Evil had something to prove.

This went long, and had lots of hard-hitting strikes.

Okada won after a cluster of Rainmakers. Nice.

## Conclusion

Really, really good show.

Evil is eliminated. Ibushi/Okada on Saturday is for the block!
