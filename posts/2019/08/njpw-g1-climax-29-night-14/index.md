B block action in Night 14 of G1 Climax 29!

Full disclosure, I watched this show without reviewing it, and then watched the next two shows. So I have no clue what went on in the tag matches of this show and my reviews of the block matches will be even shorter than normal. Sorry! I've made up for it with some extra text on the next two shows.

## Ren Narita & Shota Umino vs Toa Henare and Yuyu Uemura

Shota pinned Uemura with a suplex. Toa Henare was angry that his team got beat by a pair of Young Lions.

## Zack Sabre Jr & Lance Archer & Minoru Suzuki vs Evil & Sanada & Bushi

Suzuki piledrivered Bushi.

## Bad Luck Fale & Yujiro Takahashi & Chase Owense vs Kota Ibushi & Hiroshi Tanahashi & Tomoaki Honma

Chase pinned Honma after a Package Piledriver

## Kazuchika Okada & Will Ospreay & Yoshi-Hashi vs Kenta & Clark Connors & Karl Fredericks

Yoshi-Hashi tapped out Connors with a Butterfly Lock

## Tomohiro Ishii vs Toru Yano

Yano sat on a chair outside the ring and tried to get Ishii to come out and fight him, but Ishii stayed in the ring. The referee started counting Yano out so he ran back in the ring to fight.

After that Yano had an actually serious match, countering Ishii's hard shorts with his own. It was surprising!

Ishii won with a Brainbuster. Good match, Yano's best.

## Juice Robinson vs Taichi

Taichi won with Black Mephisto.

## Hirooki Goto vs Jeff Cobb

Goto won with a GTR

## Jon Moxley vs Jay White

Jay won with the Blade Runner. A-booooo! Moxley went down whilst giving Jay the finger, which was cool.

## Tetsuya Naito vs Shingo Takagi

Naito won with Destino. Good match!

## Conclusion

This was a good show yet again. All the block matches were good with Naito/Takagi and Moxley/White being awesome. Really good show.
