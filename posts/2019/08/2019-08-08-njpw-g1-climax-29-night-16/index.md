I'm caught up! It's Night 16, B block, fight!

## Yota Tsuji & Yuyu Uemura vs Shota Umino & Ren Narita

This was a fine Young Lions match.

Shota Umino won with a Fisherman's Suplex. It was fine.

## Bad Luck Fale & Chase Owens & Yujiro Takahashi vs Evil & Sanada & Bushi

Sanada has had a good tournament, it's a shame he will end with Fale. This match certainly existed.

Chase won with a Package Piledriver to Bushi.

## Zack Sabre Jr & Lance Archer & Minoru Suzuki vs Kenta & Clark Connors & Karl Fredericks

Typical excellent Suzuki-gun dickishness to start this match, throwing the other team to the outside and brutalising Young Lions.

Suzuki pinned one of the Americans after a Piledriver. After the match Zack worked over Kenta's surgically-repaired shoulder.

## Kota Ibushi & Will Ospreay & Toa Henare vs Kazuchika Okada & Hiroshi Tanahashi & Yoshi-Hashi

These teams seem backwards to me, surely it should be Okada/Ospreay team against Ibushi/Tanahashi. Oh well.

Okada/Ibushi Things went crazy at the end with guys flying all over the place.

Yoshi-Hashi pinned Henare after a Fisherman's Buster. Good god, Okada/Ibushi and Ospreay/Tanahashi are both on the next show. That is going to be lit!

## Taichi vs Toru Yano

Taichi took forever to take his ring gear off and Yano shouted at him to hurry. Taichi eventually got changed but jumped outside the ring to postpone even more. Yano eventually got annoyed and left but got jumped by Yoshinobu Kanemaru.

The two exchanged nonsense, with Taichi wrapping Yano up in the ring apron aiming for a count out but Yano got back in the ring in time.

Yano got the win with highjinks. Kanemaru tried to spit whiskey in Yano's eyes, but he dodged and aimed it at Taichi. Yano then punched the both of them in the dick and wrapped them up in the ring apron causing them to get counted out. Fun match.

## Tetsuya Naito vs Jeff Cobb

Naito was very slow here, more so than he has through most of the tournament. He was mocking Cobb with sumo taunts, and started working over the knee.

One awesome move saw Cobb have Naito in a fireman's carry, and throw and spin him into the air. It looked insane.

Naito countered Tour of the Islands into Destino, and then hit a second Destino for the win. Fine match.

## Jon Moxley vs Hirooki Goto

Good match but a bit short. The two traded lots of heavy blows throughout the match, this was very much a brawl. The two brawled outside and were getting counted out but jumped back into the ring at 19.

Goto won after turning a Death Rider into the GTR. Shocking win, I assumed Moxley would win this and lose his last match to Juice. I wonder what will happen now.

## Jay White vs Juice Robinson

This match was fine. It had typical Jay White rubbish, but Juice tried his best to outsmart him.

After some nonsense, Jay hit Juice's leg with a chair, put him in his inverted figure four and Juice tapped out. Good match.

## Shingo Takagi vs Tomohiro Ishii

YYYYEEEESSSSSSS!!!! This match was two dudes beating the shit out of each other, I loved it!

There's very little to describe this match, the entire thing was the two trading heavy blows and seeing who could take the most punishment. There were very, very few wrestling moves, it was 99% chops and forearms and it was amazing.

Shingo won with Last of the Dragon. Fucking yes this match was amazing. Shingo's best of the tournament, Ishii's best of the tournament, possibly match of the tournament. Off the top of my head the only one I can think is possibly better is Okada/Ospreay, but I may prefer this.

## Conclusion

Really good show made awesome by the main event. That was such an excellent match, if it's not the best match of the tournament it's certainly in the top 3. Highly recommended.

Naito, Moxley, White,Â  and Goto are the only ones left alive in B block. Due to tie breakers the winner isn't just going to be determined by who wins on the next show, they also need specific other people to win/lose. I really like that, as A block is going to be determined simply by the winner of Ibushi/Okada, but B block is a total mess, it's a really nice dichotomy.
