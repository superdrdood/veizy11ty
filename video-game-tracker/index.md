Welcome to the Veizy Video Game Tracker!

This page tracks all of the video games I have played and completed, along with the dates those things happened.

Iâ€™ve only been keeping regular records since late 2020, all dates before then were scraped from achievement/trophy acquisition so are not a complete picture.

Select a game to show the dates I played and/or completed that game, and select a year to see games from different years.

Please enjoy this look into the games I have played!
